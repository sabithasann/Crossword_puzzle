A crossword puzzle is a word-based puzzle typically presented as a grid of black and white squares. 
The objective is to fill the white squares with words that intersect, based on clues provided for "Across" 
(horizontal) and "Down" (vertical) directions. We have implemented functions such as user 
authentication, gameplay, score tracking, administrative features, and file-based storage. The game is 
console-based and implemented in Python.
